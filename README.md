## Project Requirements (Dev Machine)

To run **Sylink** locally (pre-Docker), install the following global tools:

### üîß Global Dependencies

### üîê Local HTTPS Dev (Angular)

To support local development over **HTTPS**:

- A self-signed SSL cert is auto-generated and stored in:

  ```
  ClientApp/ssl/localhost.crt
  ClientApp/ssl/localhost.key
  ```

- This happens automatically as part of:
  ```
  task setup
  ```

---

> ‚Ñπ These global dependencies are only required for local development.  
> Once full Docker setup is in place, all tooling will be containerized.

## Project Architecture

**Sylink** is a full-stack, real-time collaboration platform built with a modular, container-ready architecture optimized for team collaboration and feature isolation.

### Core Technologies

- **.NET 9 Web API** ‚Äî Backend built with ASP.NET Core, using Identity for auth and SignalR for real-time messaging
- **Angular 19 SPA** ‚Äî Frontend built with Angular standalone components and feature-based routing
- **PostgreSQL** ‚Äî Relational database powered by EF Core and managed via Docker
- **Docker + Compose** ‚Äî Used for local and staging environments, including containerized Postgres and backend
- **Taskfile CLI** ‚Äî Cross-platform dev automation (setup, dev, deploy tasks)

---

### Project Folder Structure

The backend and frontend are fully decoupled but integrated via REST APIs and SignalR. The monorepo is structured for scalability, and all services are orchestrated via `Taskfile` and Docker.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Implementation Notes

Be sure to read the [`WebApi/README.md`](WebApi/README.md) ‚Äî it contains important implementation details, warnings, and backend-specific todos.
Also read the [`ClientApp/README.md`](ClientApp/README.md) ‚Äî it contains angular specific todos.

Even as the sole contributor for now, treat it as a reference point for in-progress logic, things to revisit, and lower-level architectural decisions.
